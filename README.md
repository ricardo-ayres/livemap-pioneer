# livemap-pioneer
This is a project to write a live map to the pioneer space simulator:
 http://pioneerspacesim.net/

## Initial objectives:
- [ ] Understand pioneer's physics (inspect src/DynamicBody.cpp and src/Ship.cpp)
- [ ] Find ways to expose the relevant data, preferably without touching the pioneer source (lua?)

## Future goals:
- [ ] Plot current player and main system objects position on a web interface
- [ ] Calculate player future trajectory based on current data
- [ ] Plan future manouvers and plot the initial, current and planned trajectories
